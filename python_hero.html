  </ul>
  <p>This data is collected solely to improve the app and user experience.</p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Python Hero does <strong>not integrate</strong> with third-party services such as AdMob, Google Analytics, or social media SDKs. Therefore, no personal or behavioral data is shared externally.</p>

  <p>If any third-party services are introduced in future updates, this policy will be updated accordingly.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
